## Math Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations, __(AKA. Arithmetic operations)__

1. Addition, `+`
2. Subtraction, `-`
3. Multiplication, `*`
4. Division, `/` (Exact Answer, float)
   Division, `//` (Quotient, integer)
5. Modulo, `%` (Remainder)
6. Exponent, `**`

*Ex.* 
`print (2 + 1)`
> 3 

`print(5 % 3)`
> 2
  
`print(2 ** 3)`
> 8 

## Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables

0. Simple Assignment `=`
1. Addition Assignment `+=`
2. Subtract Assignment `-=`
3. Multiply Assignment `*=`
4. Divide Assignment `/=`
   Divide Assignment `//=`
5. Modulo Assignment `%=`
6. Exponent Assignmnet `**=`

### Rule for using Assignment Operators
A variable must be declared before using an assignment operator with variable 

*Ex. *
```
a = 5
a += 2 # equivalent to a = a + 2
print(a)
```
  > 7
